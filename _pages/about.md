I'm Shijie Feng, currently studying in [M2 de Mathématiques fondamentales](https://master-math-fonda.imj-prg.fr/) of[Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/). My research interests lie in Arithmetic Geometry and Algebraic Geometry, with a particular focus on $p$-adic cohomology theories (such as crystalline and prismatic cohomology). I am also interested in the applications of homotopical algebra and $\infty$-categories to arithmetic problems.
