I'm Shijie Feng <span style="font-family: 'STKaiti', 'KaiTi', 'BiauKai', '楷体', serif; font-size: 105%;">(冯诗藉)</span>, currently studying in [M2 de Mathématiques Fondamentales](https://master-math-fonda.imj-prg.fr/) of [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/). My research interests lie in Arithmetic Geometry and Algebraic Geometry, with a particular focus on $p$-adic cohomology theories (such as crystalline and prismatic cohomology). I am also interested in the applications of homotopical algebra and $\infty$-categories to arithmetic problems.
